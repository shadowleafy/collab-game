# Contributing

## Rules

All contributions must be complete. Incomplete code is not allowed.

## Setup

Clone into the repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shadowleafy/collab-game.git
$ cd collab-game
```

If you don't have npm or Node.js installed,
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is the recommended method.

Setup the npm project:

```bash
$ npm i
```

Setup is complete.

## Before committing to or merging with the `main` branch

- Check your code to ensure functionality
- Compile your code (if you modified TypeScript files) using `npm run compile`
